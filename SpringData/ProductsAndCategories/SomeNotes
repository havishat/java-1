some notes on adding item in many-to-many relationship 
only finished adding category to product.categories, too lazy to finish the rest.


need both category id and product id to finish this?? there is maybe easier way.

service.addCategoryToProduct(cateId, id);


example:
@Service
1. to add a category, I need to get that product from db

Product product = productRepo.findOne(id)

2. get that category from db using category id.

Category category = categoryRepo.findOneCatrgory(id);

3. add category into categories in product LOCALLY(it happens in service but not saved in db yet)

	product.categories.add(category)
// product.categories is type List<Category> and List has method "add", List.add(obj)

4. save this change
	productRepo.save(product)
	
	
combine the codes i get:
		Product product = productRepo.findOne(id);
		product.getCategories().add(categoryRepo.findOne(cateId));
		productRepo.save(product);

maybe in one line?:
	productRepo.(productRepo.findOne(id).getCategories().add(categoryRepo.findOne(cateId)));
	
should work but too complicated to read.
